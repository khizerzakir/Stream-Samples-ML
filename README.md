# Machine Learning for Prediction/Interpolation of elemental concentrations usign Stream Sediment Samples

The main objective of this project is to estimate zinc concentration with the aid of Machine Learning Regresssion algorithms, based on the stream sediment samples collected in the DZV.

The data was collected from the [Brazilian Geological Survey (CPRM)](https://rigeo.cprm.gov.br/handle/doc/19397) in the folder of the Destrito Zinc√≠fero de Vazante, Minas Gerais (MG), Brasil
